A one- or two-paragraph write-up describing, at a high level, what you would do differently if you were asked to build this as a full-scale web application. In your write-up, please focus on the technical differences between the command-line program and the web application, rather than on the product differences.

To convert this cli program to a full-scale web application, we need to do:

1. Register a domain and set up a web server and install node.js as development environment
2. Use express framework to create a server, handling the routes, connectting to a database and implement REST APIs
3. Pick a js framework to build the client side application to call the services and visulize the data to customers
2. Polyfill the code from ES6 to ES5 to support older browsers 
3. Use webpack/gulp to bundle and minify the resources

Web application is delivered to a local device over the Internet from a remote server(Software as a Service), it has  advantages over command-line program:
1. Using a modern web browser can deliver more interactive, media-rich user interfaces
2. The user can accesses the application using the web browser without having to install/update application
3. The complex application service are delivered from romote servers so the clients don't need to wory about their machines'  storage and CPU processing power
